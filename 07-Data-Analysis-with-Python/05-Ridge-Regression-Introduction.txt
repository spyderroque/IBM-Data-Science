Ridge Regression Introduction
Ridge regression is a regression that is employed in a Multiple regression model when Multicollinearity occurs. Multicollinearity is when there is a strong relationship among the independent variables. Ridge regression is very common with polynomial regression.  The next video shows how Ridge regression is used to regularize and reduce the standard errors to avoid over-fitting a regression model
